            <h2>Key Terms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-Delay: The short period of silence before the reverberation starts, which helps separate the original sound from the reflections.</li>
                <li>Decay Time: The length of time it takes for the reverberation to fade completely.</li>
                <li>Delay Time: The time interval between repeated echoes, often synchronized to the tempo of the song.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>Reverberation</h3>
                    <p>Reverberation is the reflection of sound waves off surfaces in a physical space. It makes the listener feel like the sound exists in a real environment (hall, plate, room, etc.)<a href="https://www.avixa.org/pro-av-trends/articles/what-is-reverb"> Avixa: What is Reverb?</a></p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Delay</h3>
                    <p>Delay is when an echo is played back after a short, specific period of time. This gives the illusion of depth, size, or rhythmic effect.</p>
                    
                    <p class="ref">The time of the delay is often synchronized to the tempo of the song (quarter notes, eighth notes) to ensure it complements the rhythm and doesn't sound cluttered.</p>
