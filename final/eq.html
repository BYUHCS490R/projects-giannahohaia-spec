                <p>The human hearing range is around 20 Hz to 20 kHz.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sub-Bass (20-60 Hz): aka "Rumble", felt more than heard.</li>
                    <li>Low Mids (250-500 Hz): Often responsible for "muddiness" in a mix.</li>
                    <li>Presence (2-4 kHz): Where vocals cut through the mix.</li>
                    <li>Air (10-20 kHz): Clarity and sparkle.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Equalization (EQ) is the process of adjusting the balance of frequencies in a digital signal. We use EQ to enhance desirable parts of a sound and reduce harsh or muddy parts. 
</p>
            
            <p>Engineers often use a High Pass Filter (HPF) to remove unnecessary low-frequency rumble (sub-bass) from instruments like vocals or acoustic guitar. This cleans up the low end of a mix, which is an important concept in mastering. <a href="https://audiouniversityonline.com/audio-high-pass-filters/">Audio University: HPF Guide</a></p>
