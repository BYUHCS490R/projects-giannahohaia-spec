                <li>Sub-Bass (20-60 Hz): aka "Rumble", felt more than heard.</li>

                <li>Presence (2-4 kHz): Where vocals cut through the mix.</li>
                <li>Air (10-20 kHz): Clarity and sparkle.</li>

            <h2>Equalization Basics</h2>
            
            <p>Equalization (EQ) is the process of adjusting the balance of frequencies in an digital signal. We use EQ to enhance desirable parts of a sound and reduce harsh or muddy parts. 
</p>
            
            <p>Engineers often use an HPF (High Pass Filter) to remove unnecessary low-frequency rumble (sub-bass) from instruments like vocals or acoustic guitar. This cleans up the low end of a mix, which is a key concept in mastering. <a href="https://audiouniversityonline.com/audio-high-pass-filters/">Audio University: HPF Guide</a></p>
