            <h3>Frequency Guide</h3>
            <p>The human hearing range is roughly 20 Hz to 20 kHz.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Sub-Bass (20-60 Hz):** Rumble, felt more than heard.</li>
                <li>**Low Mids (250-500 Hz):** Often responsible for "mud" in a mix.</li>
                <li>**Presence (2-4 kHz):** Where vocals cut through the mix.</li>
                <li>**Air (10-20 kHz):** Clarity and sparkle.</li>

            <h2>Equalization (EQ) Basics</h2>
            
            <p>Equalization, or **EQ**, is the process of adjusting the **balance of frequency components** within an electronic signal. We use EQ to enhance desirable parts of a sound and reduce undesirable, harsh, or muddy parts.

            <h3>Key Filter Types</h3>
            <p>A primary function of EQ is to create **spectral space** for each instrument. The most common filter used for cleanup is the High-Pass Filter (HPF).</p>
            
            <p class="ref-text">Engineers often use an **HPF** to remove unnecessary low-frequency rumble (sub-bass) from instruments like vocals or acoustic guitar. This cleans up the low end of the entire mix, which is a key concept in mastering. <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/highpass-lowpass-filter-guide/" target="_blank">Sweetwater: HPF Guide</a> (Reference 3 of 5).</p>
